* Native Stemmers
This crate implements some stemmer algorithms found in the [[http://snowballstem.org/][snowball project]] which are compiled to rust using a [[https://github.com/JDemler/snowball][rust-backend]] for the snowball language.

* Supported Algorithms

- Arabic
- English
- French 
- German
- Italian
- Portuguese
- Romanian
- Spanish

* Usage
``` rust
extern crate native_stemmers;

use native_stemmers::{Algorithm, Stemmer};

let en_stemmer = Stemmer::create(Algorithm::English);
assert_eq!(en_stemmer.stem("fruitlessly"), "fruitless");

```

* Issues
Generated code is neither beautiful nor idiomatic nor optimized and full of warnings. 
There are some very low hanging fruit to fix this. 
Contributions to the rust backend or this crate are very welcome.
